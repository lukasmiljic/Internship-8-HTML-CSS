            <p>
                This page was inspired by a <a href="#">tweet from Salma</a> .
                Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and
                accessible. But here we are. I'm trying my best.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="how-does-this-work">
            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p> The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a
                role="presentation" attribute to make decorated sections
                without css. If you view source on the page, you'll see
                that there are a LOT of tables. The table tag typically
                is used to display tabular data and should NOT be used
                as a layout method. However, since I am not allowed to
                use CSS, I am pretty much exclusively relying on tables
                for this purpose. The presentation role tells the browser
                to not expose the table and its tabluar children in the
                accessibility tree. This will make it easier to navigate
                for assistive technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements from
                HTML 3.2 that you should never use. In order to be "compliant",
                I've added the HTML 3.2 doctype at the top of the page:
                <span id="code">&gt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "&quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN&quot;&lt;</span>
                This helps give a hint to the browser that we are going to use some older stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as details/summary,
                section, main, header, and footer. So I'm just making a mess of my
                doctype and what I should be actually using!
